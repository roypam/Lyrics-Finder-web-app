**Lyrics Finder**

Brief - To create a single page application that relies heavily on one or more APIs.

Users who wish to look up the lyrics of a specific song can do so by using Lyric Finder.

The user can search by artist or by song name and is returned a list of results through which they can navigate to find the lyrics of the song they are looking for.

The page is now live at https://roypam.github.io/Lyrics-Finder-web-app/
